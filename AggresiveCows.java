
//finding out largest min distance
//Time Complexity O(N*log(n))
// Problem Statement: There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. 
// The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,â€¦.,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). 
//     We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. 
//     What is the largest minimum distance?

// Examples:

// Input: No of stalls = 5 
//        Array: {1,2,8,4,9}
//        And number of cows: 3

// Output: One integer, the largest minimum distance 3
